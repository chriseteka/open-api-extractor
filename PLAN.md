# Plans

* [ ] Convert from source to latest version of swagger (i.e `3.0`)
* [ ] Input file and the APIs of interest can be passed in the config (application.yaml)
* [ ] Write the result to a file
* [ ] Some more things to come (Maybe turn it to an API)

##  Challenges to fix:
* Make sure to use proper structure of v3
* Make sure to give defaults for empty keys
* Make sure to form the proper traversal path from one to another
* Write tests that shows the round trip
* Remove areas we identified as bad in the todo
